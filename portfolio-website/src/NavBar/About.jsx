      Welcome to my world! I'm Garv Batra — a student, a self-proclaimed tech geek, and someone who sometimes wins the fight against bugs (and sometimes loses to semicolons). Right now, I'm really into web development, robotics, and artificial intelligence, and I'm trying to understand how things work — and sometimes, I even make them work myself. 
      </p>

      I created this portfolio to share my journey: the projects I've made, the ideas I've tried, and those late-night moments when I ask, “Wait… why isn’t this working?” and then realize, “Oh. ” Whether I’m designing simple websites, building small automation tools, or playing around with AI models, I learn best by doing. 
      </p>

      This space shows the kind of thinking I try to keep in mind. So feel free to explore, judge my code, or reach out if you want to collaborate or just geek out over something cool!
